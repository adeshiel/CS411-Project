## Why we chose a Flask stack ##
Our decision process was very short. We chose a Flask stack since some of our group members hadn't used it before. Others found it easier to explore a new APIs and framework (OpenCV) in a language they're comfortable in, Python. We hadn't really considered any other stack since we were satisfied with our first choice.
