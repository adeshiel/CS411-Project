## Why we chose a Flask stack ##
Our decision making was rather simple, because both of our API frameworks (OpenCV and Microsoft Azure) have calls in python. That was quiet good for us, because we were all comfortable coding in python. For the web app framework we went with Flask, because someof our members had experience with it before and some were eager to learn more about it. We've also created templates in HTML and CSS for the front end and connected it through Flask. We hadn't really considered any other stack choices, because everyone was happy with python and it was enough to achieve the functionality we had planned.
