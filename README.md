### Dramafy
Make your life into an anime or drama! Use a webcam/video, run emotional analysis on it and play suitable sound effects and/or add random subtitles or overlays based on the emotions and actions in the video (i.e. add subs if the person is talking, if someone is sad, grayscale the current video). We plan to use Microsoft Azure to run sentiment analysis and Spotify for suitable background music based on the sentiment analysis. We plan to have a database containing any effects tied to a particular sentiment score and we plan to use OpenCV for programming video edits.
