## Possible Ideas

### Dramafy
Make your video into an anime or drama! Use a webcam/video, run emotional analysis on it and play suitable sound effects and/or add random subtitles or overlays based on the emotions and actions in the video (i.e. add subs if the person is talking, if someone is sad, grayscale the current video).

### Musical Sessions
Based on your current browsing session, make a spotify playlist to match and play it in the background! Possibly using sentiment analysis and something to scrape the text from the webpages.
